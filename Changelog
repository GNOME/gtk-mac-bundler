Changes in version 0.6.0:

 - Bump Version to 0.6.0 (John Ralls)

 - Add some protective code in translations function (John Ralls)

 - Added new attribute, "recurse", to Path class. (John Ralls)
 - Protect against adjusting already-adjusted paths (John Ralls)

 - Add Guillaume Lessard's localization code to the example launcher. (John Ralls)
 - Correct the version strings. (John Ralls)

 - Add support to copy designated translation files (foo.po and foo.mo) (John Ralls)

Changes in O.5.2

 - Bumped Version (John Ralls)
 - Removed two ToDos that are already done (John Ralls)
